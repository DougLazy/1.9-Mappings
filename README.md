### Getting Started
I prefer [MultiMC] as it is extremely simple to use, so that's what I'll be using for these instructions.

(This assumes that you have installed MultiMC and Enigma, cloned the repo, and are familiar with using Enigma)

1. In MultiMC, create a new instance using the most recent snapshot version of Minecraft 1.9.
2. Open the [Enigma] tool by [Cuchaz].
3. Under the `File` menu press `Open Jar...`.
4. Select the jar for the latest snapshot which can be found in `/path/to/multimc/versions/15w31c/15w31c.jar`.
5. After the Enigma has loaded the jar, press `Open Mappings...` in the `File` menu.
6. Select the `1.9.mappings` file from the repository.
7. **Deobfuscate!**
