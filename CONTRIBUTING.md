## Directory Structure ##

For each major snapshot (i.e. 15w31) there is to be a folder. For each subsequent a/b/c there should be a new mapping with the name a/b/c. For example, for 15w31c there is a file 15w31/c.mappings

## Workflow ##

### Git ###

TODO, this needs to be figured out more :P

#### Pulling ####

Before making any changes pull the current mappings. When you pull, make sure to re-open the mappings in Enigma, otherwise you will just delete the other person's changes when you save
